A basic card catalog.  The goal for this sucker is to assist in a closed source game project Im working on.  While the game might be closed source, this card catalog will be universal and basic.

#### Things to do:
- [ ] scaffold dir structure
- [ ] stub out `Models` ie:  fields?
- [ ] basic system of: mongodb, internet connection, x-platform
- [ ] wrap it one of the new fangled atom
- [ ] basic auth
- [ ] dynamic HTML5 design that fits all logical form factors
- [ ] activeadmin or alternative?
